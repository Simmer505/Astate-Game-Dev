# Astate Game Dev 

This is the code for my game development course I am doing concurrently through Astate.

## Assignments

### 1.2

I was able to modify my world moving, scaling, rotating, and adding new objects.
I also downloaded and [asset pack](https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/3d/environments/urban/snaps-prototype-school-154693) I got for free with the Unity Student Plan.

### 2.2

I made a difficult obstacle course with a few different challenges:

	* Spinning Platform
		* In this obstacle you have to jump on a spinning platform and use it as 
		 a ramp to get to the other side.
	* Dodge the obstacles
		* In this obstacle you have to dodge the obstacle coming at you.
		 They spawn at a random offset from the spawner at the end of the obstacle.
	* Spinning obstacle
		* For this you have to jump around the platforms fast enough that the 
		 spinning obstacle does not hit you.
	* Rigidbody balls
		* To pass this you just need to push through the balls and get to the other
		 side.
	* Jumping challenge
		* For the final challenge you have to jump over spinning bars while you run
		 the end of the platform. The platform is also constantly changing size.
	* End
		* Once you get to the end you will find some food models that I got from
		 the unity asset store.

I also added a few lights to help light up the course.
